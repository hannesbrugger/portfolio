# Cantho

Before moving to Can Tho our Team decreases to just one developer, me. In this time the main focus was to build the routing of the questionflow.

#### QuestionFlow
In this Flow the user has to answer 2 questions with each 4 posible answers, what makes an outcome of 16 posible combinations.
Each combination should redirect to a own page. The solution is to just combine the two answers and use this string to fetch the new page with a UID call. 

#### Astro
All those reactive parts like this Flow need special treat in Astro. 
Astro core purpose is less JavaScript therefore there is no JS on client site by default. But with a simple <code>client:load</code>

## Office
This Office is by far the youngest I've been, I think I even was one of the older ones what in Germany whould be unbelivable.
Althought I was loked in in the toilet at the first days I liked the office. On a small space it has everything you need
- kitchen
- working room
- 3 meetingrooms
- and a Tablesocer

Like in many offices we went out on fridays and eating together and in workingtime I got a close connection to neightbours that helped me a lot. 
In that time the team was growing again and funnily a guy of this office joint along with my old team member.


## City
CanTho is a very calm and quiet city compared to Saigon, with the famous floating market and much less tourists.
The streets are the first thing that catched my heart. They are smaller, with more marketplaces and many trees have a chain of warm glowing lamps. The river also gives many options to enjoi food and music on a cool ship.
There is also a little Iland on the river with traditional houses and an amusement park 

I also went to a mountain more far a way next to the border of Kambotscha. There was a buddha statue and a temple
