# DaNang
The city is often called the best in Vietnam and here is what I experienced.

## Progress

During my time in DaNang I had a lot to do with fixig design issues. I learned a lot about i18n and the routing system of Astro. But I also lost my team colleagues so that I'm alone again.

#### Fixing Design
During this work I struggled with using git and not loosing your selfe in fixing to much on one branch. The different stages of a fixing procedure like taking an open task from trello, name the new branch after it, checking if you are up to date with the develope branch, fixing, ....   challenged me for a while but that is how you know you learn something new. 

#### i18n
I already took a look into multilanguage in bangkok but now it was time to put it in action. With i18n you can build a simple multilanguage page because it switches the content based on the current language. In Astro it is implemented through a higher folder level which represent the different languages. So you have all the code for the pages twice what doesn't follows DRY but you are very flexible to change style based on a specific language.
So I designed and added a button to switch between languages. It is located on every page.

#### Documentation
I thought it would be good to start a documantation to give the people using the page a better understanding. Over time I wrote a text document with over 80 pages, describing all the slices and thier artibutes on prismic. Everything liked together described with images.

## Office
The office is in the middle of the city in a litte skycraper on the highest flor. You can have a look around the hole city and during my stay there was a fireworks competition which you can see from here.

We where always eating together and I alway got vegetarian food in an easy way and very cheap !
The people in here are very happy and often ask me to do something together, like playing football every friday. During my time here the vietnam wide office competion took place. People of all offices came to DaNang and showed their performences in singing, dancing and more !

## City
The city offers a lot. You have the sea with nice beaches, the mountains and much better air. You can even see it when you see the happy people. This is also the reason for many tourists from mainly Korea. You don't have to always take the calm side of the city because there are also many big clubs.
