# Bangkok

To extent my visa I had to leave the country, so I went to the next office in Bangkok.
The time in here was mainly used to build and improve the components ( or better called Slices ) of the website.

#### Extend
One part was to to show more Cards when clicking on a "show more" button. Sound easy and it could be but we are using Astro and JavaScript is not welcomed. So I learned some tricks in just using HTML and CSS and I was surprised whats its able to alone. 

#### ContentBuilder
To seperate ArticleContent (Images, Text, ...) from the normal Slices, I also build a new builder that puts all the different slices together and adds an "show more" button. This way it is possible to add different behaviors to the slices such as a side-padding.

## Office
The office is part of a co working Space in the Center of Bangkok. It is the most modern I ever seen,
- with an own App
- big meetingrooms rooms
- and a Tablesocer, table tennis, ...
- a kitchen
- ...

We where always eating together one flor down. It is like a big market with alot of food and places to sit. But all in all there isn't much for vegetarian people.

## City
Of course this city offers a lot of clubs and I found people to join.
In the big mals like Central World you shound have a guide or you get lost, it very big !
But if you stay that long in Bangkok you have to see the old capital Ayutthaya and the temples.
