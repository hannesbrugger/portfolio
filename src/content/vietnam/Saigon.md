## Saigon - The Start

I started My trip in Saigon or Ho Chi Minh. I joined <a href="https://nfq.com/">NFQ</a> a internatiional company in the IT sector that provides many IT solutions to customers around the world. 
At first I was introduced to the core principes of NFQ and agile development.
My pleasure was to start here in the headquater of the company. It first took a little bit of time but than I got a new project and an team partner.
The project includes a few new technologyes that are very interesting, we used:

### TechStack
- Astro - a JavaScript web framework optimized for building fast, content-driven websites
- Tailwind - a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
- Prismic -  the headless page builder that lets developers and marketers ship and iterate faster, 



The start wasn't easy. Building in an team for customers is much more different than building something for your own.
Things like using Git, creating tickets on Trello, or reading the right parameters from figma.
I also got the first real contact to the Scrum concept with all it's members and procedures of building strong software.

## The office

Like every headquater the office in Saigon looks very nice. 
Every are plants (real ones) and many wodden parts that makes a normal office feels very warm and happy. Back in the Developer area there are many seats (the most of all offices) where the different teams work and colaborate.

For such a big office you can still feel comunity vibes origined from a shared kitchen, cafeteria, and monthly meetings for the hole company, where you hear the current situation of every office.

In these times many meetings slide in to our calender. Therefore the office provides many meeting rooms (named after cities NFQ has an office in) you can book. But also for the online ones you can get a quiet place in all those little boxes spread around the office like you see in the second picture.
